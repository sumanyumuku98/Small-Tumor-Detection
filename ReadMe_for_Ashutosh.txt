Hi Ashutosh,

The details of the files present are as follows:

1. Makefile is the main program. You will get all the running instructions in the same file

2. Requirements.txt tells the files to be downloaded

3. Models is the folder which contains the programs related to models

4. Datasets is the folder which contains programs related to data pre-processing

5. README.md is the original readme, written by the person who wrote the base code for this project. This will give you information about the place where you can download the pre-trained weights, for initialisation.

6. Utils is the folder which has additional programs required for training and testing

7. Weights is the folder in which the trained weights will get saved

8. Data is the folder where you can put the data

9. The programs main.py and trainer.py are used to train the model.

Please do contact me back for any issues/clarifications.
